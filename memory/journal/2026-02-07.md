**03:06 UTC** — Really amazing day. Minimal imaginary conversations about work. Focused work using NotebookLM + sources to establish team dialogue and develop perspective on an AI business. Strong synergy with vibe coding running on separate laptop all day — by far the most profound vibe coding experience yet. Been sharing the approach with Melissa, mom, and friends. Great energy throughout. Still had time for gym and other activities. "Amazing to see how much you can do in one single day."

**03:08 UTC** — Reflecting: still a lot to build with this app. Flow state will fade but more upside to go. Wants to leverage this experience to improve interview performance at Pantera/FirstMark. Considering what else to build after this is stable.

**15:21 UTC** — Spinning class logged (see fitness/2026-02-07-spinning.md). Difficulty: 7/10.

**15:23 UTC** — Lower back update: woke up 8/10 sore (worse than yesterday's 4/10). Walking triggers discomfort, but cycling felt fine. No aggravation during spin session.

**15:25 UTC** — Masseuse and PT scheduled next week. Assessment: muscular strain (no nerve symptoms). Will continue monitoring.
