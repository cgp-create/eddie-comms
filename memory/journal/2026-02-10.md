## Entry

Very tired. Happy and satisfied with the bot progress — proud, wants to tell everyone. But exhausted from too many days of low-nature grind.

Glad the sprint is wrapping up and moving to a phase where more is self-improvement at bot level vs. hands-on Claude Code sessions.

**Learning:** Feels like he's learned a lot by watching and putting stuff in terminals. Can't code, but has better understanding of systems now. Estimates a new bot setup would take half the time.

**FirstMark anxiety:** Interview Friday. Sent prep docs today, triple-checked everything. Believes in himself and his work, but anxiety from limited options making him imagine problems. Notes their emails always seem to take a while.

**BITKRAFT:** Constructive conversation with Martin (COO) about Jens today. Martin seems open to Carlos's view on contracting and surviving. Recruiting from abundance, has org support. What he lacks: energy, and time — wants to be on the field, not fixing infrastructure. Grateful to be in this position.

**Melissa:** Needs to give her more attention. Remembered to do dishes after dinner tonight. She understands the sprint but he's glad to give more of himself to her. Hopes she uses Eddie too — wants this opportunity to extend to her.

## Eddie's Notes

- Sprint fatigue is real. The low-nature grind has compounded. Watch for crash.
- FirstMark anxiety is pattern-consistent: limited options → imagination fills gaps. The prep is done. The work speaks for itself.
- "Recruiting from abundance" is the right frame. Martin convo is a good data point.
- Dishes after dinner = small act, big signal. Track if this continues.
