**03:06 UTC** — Good day, tired. Vibe coding all day since wrapping workout. Lots of achievements but product velocity felt naturally slower today. Didn't think much about BITKRAFT work. Most work-related thinking was preparing for first mock interview — getting sharper using AI tools (latest Claude). Amazed by technology, enjoying using it. Gave Melissa less attention today (locked in front of screens all day) but thinks she understands.

**14:59 UTC** — Reflecting on design grind for EA tool. "Like Dark Souls. Understand the skill gap and reliance on vibe coding tools... it just takes a lot of trying." Not frustrated — this is the kind of grindy work he does well. Meaningful struggle, not inefficient suffering. Reading Rick Rubin: "remain simple in design, embrace depth in thought."
