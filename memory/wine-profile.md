## Burgundy (Red)

### Grand Cru

| Wine | Vintage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| DRC La Tâche | 2017 | Had it. Preferred the Arnoux-Lachaux that same evening. |
| Arnoux-Lachaux Latricières-Chambertin GC | 2017 | Preferred over La Tâche. Strong data point. |
| Dujac Clos Saint-Denis GC | 2005 | Had it. Part of 5-bottle lineup. |
| Dujac Clos de la Roche GC | 2005 | Had it. Part of 5-bottle lineup. |

### Premier Cru

| Wine | Vintage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| J-F Mugnier Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru "Clos de la Maréchale" | — | Really liked. Cheaper than expected. Appreciated by fancy crowd. Monopole. |

### Village

| Wine | Vintage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| G. Roumier Chambolle-Musigny | 2005 | Favorite of the 3 reds in the Dujac/Roumier lineup. Cheapest of the three but preferred. |

### Key Insight

Carlos's Burgundy preferences suggest he's more attuned to producer/winemaking style than to vineyard hierarchy. A well-made village wine from a top producer (Roumier) beat two Grand Crus. The Arnoux-Lachaux beating La Tâche is even more striking — both Grand Cru, but Arnoux-Lachaux at ~10% of the price.

**Producers to explore:** Roumier, Mugnier, Arnoux-Lachaux. These delivered better experiences per dollar than DRC/Dujac in his limited sampling.

## Other Sparkling (Non-Champagne)

| Wine | Vintage | Region | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Giulio Ferrari Riserva del Fondatore Collezione | 2001 | Trentodoc (Italy) | Great wine. 20+ years aged. Metodo classico. Worth seeking out. |
| Ca' del Bosco Anna Maria Clementi | 1980 | Franciacorta (Italy) | Friend returned this bottle from long ago. 45+ years old. Memory bottle — good, or maybe just impressed by what it was. Not expecting to find again. |

## Fortified

| Wine | Vintage | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Taylor Fladgate Vintage Porto | 1983 | Had it. No detailed notes captured. |

---

## Natural Wine

| Wine | Vintage | Region | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| Will Arnold "Fond Cajou" | 2023 | Coteaux du Lyonnais | Gamay. Unfined, unfiltered. Better than expected. Open to more natural wine. |

**Takeaway:** Carlos is open to well-made natural wines. Not a primary focus but worth occasional exploration.

3. **Taylor Porto + Roger Brun evening** — No preference captured
