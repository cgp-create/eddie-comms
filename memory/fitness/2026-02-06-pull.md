# Pull Day - 2026-02-06

**Time:** 20:32 UTC  
**Difficulty:** 4/10 overall (some exercises 6/10)  
**Context:** Lower back preservation mode (BJJ strain from Feb 1)

## Exercises

1. **Cable cross-body shoulder pull** (knee height, diagonal across body)
   - 3×10 @ 20 lbs
   - *Hardest exercise of session*

2. **Cable cross-body pull** (dual cables, shoulder height, horizontal X pattern)
   - 3×10 @ 20 lbs

3. **Single-arm seated row**
   - 3×10 @ 70 lbs per arm

4. **Single-arm seated lat pulldown**
   - 3×10 @ 70 lbs per arm

5. **Incline cable pullover**
   - 3×10 @ 80 lbs

6. **Arnold press**
   - 3×10 @ 15 lbs

7. **Dumbbell curl**
   - 3×20 @ 15 lbs

8. **Cable face pulls** (added per Eddie's recommendation - rear delt gap)
   - 3×15 @ 45 lbs
   - *Started at 30-40 suggestion, bumped to 45, still felt easy*

## Notes

- Light workout week to manage lower back injury
- Cross-body pulls at 20 lbs hardest due to stabilizer/coordination demands (smaller muscles, diagonal pattern)
- Face pulls should start at 50-60 lbs next time with focus on peak contraction
- No triceps (did chest + triceps yesterday)

## Injury Status

**Lower back:** Pulled in BJJ on Sunday (Feb 1). Currently 4/10 sore - mobile but limited ROM, doesn't feel good when engaged.

**Treatment plan:**
- Seeing masseuse for back
- Managing right adductor tendinitis with PT (chronic issue, years old, finally addressing)
- No BJJ for now
- Planning to spin tomorrow (Feb 7)
