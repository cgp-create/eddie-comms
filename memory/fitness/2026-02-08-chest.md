# Chest + Triceps Day - 2026-02-08

**Time:** 16:31 UTC  
**Difficulty:** 6/10  
**Context:** Individual exercises end near exhaustion, able to recover between sets. Lower back preservation mode (BJJ strain from Feb 1).

## Exercises

1. **Pec flies** (bench)
   - 3×12 @ 30 lbs

2. **Dumbbell bench press** (flat)
   - 3×10 @ 50 lbs
   - *Heavy - could maybe do 55 for 10 with a lot of strain, but much harder to stabilize laterally*
   - *Gym was full, weights were busy*

3. **Incline dumbbell bench press**
   - 3×10 @ 40 lbs

4. **Dips**
   - 3×10 (bodyweight)

5. **Cable crossover** (low to high, rope attachment through legs)
   - 3×10 @ 60 lbs

6. **Overhead tricep extension** (cable rope, pull behind head)
   - 3×15 @ 60 lbs

## Coaching Notes

**Coverage:** 
- ✅ Upper chest (incline DB press)
- ✅ Middle chest (flat DB press, pec flies)
- ✅ Lower chest (dips, cable crossovers)
- ✅ Triceps (dips compound + overhead extension isolation)

**Smart programming:** All dumbbell/cable work = no spinal loading. Back-friendly while managing injury (woke up 8/10 sore yesterday).

**50lbs DB comment:** Legitimately heavy. Dumbbell pressing requires more stabilization than barbell, especially at higher loads. The lateral stabilization demand is a feature, not a bug — builds functional strength. If 55lbs would be max strain with compromised form, 50lbs is the right load.

**Progressive overload path:** When back fully recovers and if strength goals demand it, can introduce barbell bench for heavier loads. But DB work is excellent for joint health and unilateral strength.

## Injury Status

**Lower back:** Day 7 post-injury (BJJ Feb 1). Yesterday morning 8/10 sore. Today post-workout: better than yesterday, still not 100%. Chest day avoids spinal loading entirely — smart recovery protocol.
