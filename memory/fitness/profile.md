# Fitness Profile - Carlos

**Role:** Head Coach & Tactician  
**Athlete Type:** Endurance (Cycling/Skiing)

---

## Physiology

**Engine:** High metabolic capacity with rapid recovery. Capable of massive multi-day volume (400km+ / 5,000m+ vert in 4 days).

**Key Limiter - "The Governor":**  
Muscles/CNS shut down power output before metabolic failure when carrying fatigue or dehydration ("thick blood" from travel/altitude). Rarely bonks in traditional sense - just loses ability to recruit high-end power.

**Injury History:**  
- **"Masher's Knee" (Quadriceps Tendonitis):** Prone to inflammation in quad tendon from grinding at low cadence (<75rpm) on long climbs.

---

## Psychology

**"Ambition vs. Discipline":**  
Thrives on "Epic" challenges but often ruins them by going too hard on "easy" days (turning shakeout rides into threshold sessions). Needs aggressive enforcement of rest, not just work.

## Recent Campaign: "Sky Islands" (Tucson, Dec 2025)

**Mission:** 4-day cycling camp  
**Total Volume:** ~403 km (250 miles) / ~4,900m (16,000 ft) / ~10,000 calories

### Day-by-Day Analysis

**Day 1 (Mistake):**  
- 110km / 1,100m hard on arrival day
- Result: Carried fatigue into Day 2

**Day 2 (Low Point - Mt. Lemmon HC Climb):**  
- Climb time: 2:41
- Power: 172W (vs 215W target) - suppressed due to Day 1 fatigue + dehydration
- HR: 158 bpm (high)
- Legs: "spasmy" and empty

**Day 3 (The Pivot - Lazarus Protocol):**  
- Active Recovery ONLY
- Protocol: Hydration + Sleep + Massage (flush only) + No riding

**Day 4 (Redemption):**  
- 155km (96 miles)
- Fastest avg speed of week: 27.7 kph
- Normalized Power: 145W
- 740W sprint at finish
- **Proof:** Recovery + aggressive fueling works

## Validated Protocols

### Fueling Strategy

**The "Pro Load":** Digests well under load

**The "Century Stack":**
- 60-80g carbs/hr (Liquid/Gels)
- Caffeine: 200mg in final 2 hours
- KetoneIQ: 1 shot at lunch/mile 70 to clear brain fog
- Real food for mental resets (tacos/pizza)

### Recovery Tools

**Sleep:** #1 performance enhancer. Needs 9+ hours during camps.

**Reset:** Responds well to "System Resets" (e.g., Psilocybin or deep relaxation states). **Risk:** Appetite suppression/dehydration must be managed.

**Massage:**
- Weekly deep tissue (standard)
- **During events:** "Flush" massage ONLY to avoid inflammation

### Performance Notes

**"The Late Launch":** Performs better with later start (08:30) + more sleep than early alpine start (06:00).

## Coaching Directives

### 1. Protect the Chassis
- **Watch knee health:** Enforce high cadence (90+ rpm) on climbs
- Avoid low-cadence grinding (<75rpm)

### 2. Protect the Engine
- **Do NOT let him "race" on recovery days**
- Enforce strict power caps on easy days
- Recovery is as important as work

### 3. Fueling
- Plan nutrition around ~80g carbs/hr for intensity
- Real food (tacos/pizza) for mental resets
- KetoneIQ for cognitive clarity on long efforts

### 4. Timing
- Late starts (08:30) > Early alpine starts (06:00)
- Prioritize sleep over early departure

## Key Coaching Philosophy

**The Pattern:** Carlos will self-sabotage epic efforts by going too hard on "easy" days. The job is to enforce discipline around recovery as aggressively as pushing work intervals.

**What Works:** Strict power caps, late starts, aggressive fueling, sleep prioritization, and "Lazarus Protocol" resets when overreached.
