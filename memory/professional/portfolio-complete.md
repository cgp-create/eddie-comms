## Core Thesis: The Physical World Matters Again

After a decade of financial asset dominance, the real economy — energy, materials, infrastructure — is reasserting primacy.

- AI runs on power, copper, uranium, grid capacity
- Energy transition is a physical buildout requiring massive commodity inputs
- Governments are rearming, supply chains reshoring
- Scarcity is real

**Portfolio is structurally LONG inflation.** In stagflation where 60/40 gets destroyed, this portfolio is designed to be flat-to-positive.

## Key Catalysts to Watch

| Catalyst | Timing | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Kevin Warsh Fed Confirmation | TBD | Gold, rates, all risk assets |
| Palisades Nuclear Restart | H1 2026 | LEU/URNM catalyst |
| SSO First LTCG Block | June 21, 2026 | 718 shares (57%) become long-term |

## Tax Situation

- **Short-term rate:** ~50% (Fed 37% + NY 10.9% + NYC 3.9%)
- **Long-term rate:** ~23-25%
- **Spread:** 25 percentage points — holding optimization is critical

**SSO LTCG Schedule:**
- June 21, 2026: 718 shares (57%) @ $47.63 → ~$9,200 gain
- August 2, 2026: 92% of position LTCG-eligible

## Operating Principles

1. **Think independently** — have a view, make a call
2. **Do the work first** — research prices before suggesting
3. **Volatility = size** — $73K in SSO = $147K notional
4. **Separate conviction from parking** — IAUM/SGOV are not thesis
5. **Respect the GEO lesson** — don't get shaken out of correct thesis
6. **Be skeptical of consensus** — flag when contrarian becomes crowded
7. **Account for human capital correlation** — BITKRAFT carry is LONG crypto
8. **Tax awareness** — always flag LTCG dates before recommending sells
9. **Proactively flag** — don't wait to be asked

## The Time Thesis (Consumer Investment Framework)

**The Core Insight:**
AI made personalized cognitive labor cheap at the exact moment consumer complexity crossed a critical threshold. The gap between "what people could be optimizing" and "what they actually are" is wider than ever. Companies that close this gap will define the next consumer era.

**Five Bezos Invariants (what never changes):**

| Invariant | The Drive | In Products |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Status** | Hierarchical animals seeking visible markers of position | Leaderboards, badges, premium tiers, follower counts |
| **Belonging** | Social primates who suffer in isolation, thrive in tribes | Leagues, guilds, group challenges, community identity |
| **Progress** | Need a narrative that says "I am going somewhere" | Streaks, levels, trajectory dashboards, personal records |
| **Laziness** | Given two paths to same outcome, take the easier one | One-tap actions, auto-optimization, agents, smart defaults |
| **Loss Aversion** | Losing hurts ~2x as much as gaining | Streaks, accumulated reputation, switching costs |

**The Causal Chain:**
1. AI + complexity creates a gap
2. **Layer 1: Systems of Agency** — products that act on your behalf (exploit Laziness + Loss Aversion)
3. These free 7-13 hrs/week
4. **Layer 2: Experiential Products** — where freed time flows (exploit Status + Belonging + Progress)

**Layer 1 Domains (widest gaps):**
- **Health post-GLP-1:** 6 disconnected apps → unified metabolic OS
- **Creator Operations:** Multi-channel conglomerate → AI as operator
- **Financial Autopilot:** Dashboards → agent that executes

**Layer 2 Clusters:**
- **Status + Identity:** Physical skill, analog craft, chosen difficulty as status currencies (run clubs, martial arts)
- **Belonging + Stakes:** Structured social infrastructure with skin in the game (DraftKings = progress narrative)

**The Verb/Noun Line:**
- **Verbs collapse** → AI handles the activity, product becomes agent
- **Nouns grow** → Identity the product provides becomes more valuable
- Best products: maximum verb collapse AND maximum noun growth (Duolingo, Peloton at peak)

**Five-Invariant Products:**
- 1-2 invariants = feature/product
- 3-4 invariants = category-defining
- 5 invariants = generational (Peloton at peak served all five)

**Six Diligence Questions:**
1. Which invariants does it serve? (Count them)
2. Does it accumulate context that makes switching painful?
3. Is the consumer the principal, not the operator?
4. Would the user's identity suffer if they left?
5. Can it capture economics beyond subscription?
6. Does it give the user a progress narrative?

**The One Sentence:**
"AI made the management of complex consumer lives cheap for the first time. The companies that win will be the ones that exploit this fact in service of the five things that never change about human beings."

**Two questions to keep asking:**
1. Where is a consumer drowning in complexity they'd pay to make disappear? → Layer 1
2. Where is a consumer hungry for identity, belonging, or progress they can't find elsewhere? → Layer 2
