# BITKRAFT Context

**Status:** Effectively decided to leave. Recruiting from strength. Decision is made; only timing and destination are open.

## The Problem

**Managing Partner (Jens):** Charismatic but structurally unreliable. Says the right things, doesn't follow through. Problems are fundamental, not fixable.

**Role Drift:** Became administrative — tech transitions, event planning, LP reporting. "Stadium repairman" instead of investor/craftsman. The investing craft has atrophied.

**The Wound:** Jens pointed out Carlos's staleness. It stung because it's true, even though Jens caused the conditions.

## Historical Pattern (November 2025)

- "He always sounds so good and convincing" (11/21)
- "One of those days where Jens makes you want to believe things will be better soon" (11/26)
- "Annoyed at Jens lack of engagement... He preemptively messaged me to apologize... I know i should forgive but because it exists in a pattern it's harder" (11/27)

**Assessment:** Pattern of disappointment accumulating. Charismatic but unreliable leadership.

## Mental Leak: Imaginary Conversations

**The Pattern:** Constantly rehearsing future conversations about quitting, mostly with Jens. "Living in fantasy" (Tony from Mushin's phrase).

**When it gets worse:** Boredom amplifies it  
**What reduces it:** Physical activity, flow state work (vibe coding)

**November 2025:**
- 11/22: "How much of our time is spent on conversations we'll never had"
- 11/25: "Talked to myself a bit less today... always about Jens and imagining what to say when I move on"
- 11/26: "I imagine so many worlds at so many places... So much time living in fantasy"

**February 2026 shift:**
- Feb 6-7: During vibe coding breakthrough days → "minimal imaginary conversations about work"

## What He Wants Next

**Structure over chaos:**
- Apprenticeship/partnership over solo PM
- Analytical rigor, real process
- Agency and feedback loops (liquidity over illiquidity)

**Craft over admin:**
- Generalist over specialist
- Data over intuition — later-stage, model-able businesses
- Concentration over diversification

**Culture:**
- Humor over rigidity
- Interesting problems with interesting people
- Organization with momentum and potential

## Active Interviews (Feb 2026)

**FirstMark:** The one he thinks about most. Prestigious, generalist consumer seat. High agency. The "Sniper" role.

**Pantera:** The "Eldridge of Crypto." Leverages managerial muscle. Risk: golden cage of more admin.

**The Guilt:** Feels guilty about how much money and prestige drive excitement for FirstMark. Wants to believe he's optimizing for craft, but compensation matters and he knows it.

## Reference Point

**Eldridge:** "Haven't known true grind since the Eldridge days" (11/24/2025). This is his baseline for full engagement.
