## Favorite Champagnes (Ranked)

### Elite Tier
1. **Krug Clos d'Ambonnay 1996** — Best ever. 100% Pinot Noir single vineyard. One of rarest champagnes in world.
2. **Krug 2004 Vintage** — Second best.

### Special Occasion Tier ($250-350)
- **Bollinger Grande Année Rosé** (2011, 2014 vintages) — Repeat purchase, multiple bottles
- **Krug Clos du Mesnil** — 100% Chardonnay. Liked it, but less than Pinot-dominant styles.

### Nice Day at Home ($100-150)
- **Ruinart Rosé** — Daily driver, especially half bottles ($50-60)
- **Savart Rosé** — Preferred when findable (allocation issues)

### Grower Champagnes (Cool Factor)
- **Savart** (multiple bottles, Rosé especially)
- **Egly-Ouriet**
- **Selosse Initial** — Oxidative style, only had once. "Cool because it's so different."
- **Pierre Péters "Les Chétillons" 2015** — Blanc de Blancs, Grand Cru Le Mesnil. Enjoyed it. Hard to source, expensive.
- **Roger Brun Réserve Familiale Grand Cru Extra Brut 2004** — Great value. Aged grower champagne.
- **Chartogne-Taillet "Sainte Anne" Extra Brut** — Had it, no strong memory.

### Milestone Bottles
- **Billecart-Salmon Cuvée Nicolas François** — First champagne that made him think "wow this is different" early in his journey
- **Casa Valduga 130 Blanc de Noirs** — Served at wedding (Brazilian producer, Pinot Noir-based)

### Recently Tried (Good)
- **Grand Siècle** — "Great champagne," now had a few times
- **Dom Pérignon Rosé P2 1996** — Had it as part of legendary 5-bottle lineup. No detailed notes but worth tracking given plénitude status.

---

## Outgrown / Disappointed

- **Veuve Clicquot** — Used to like when younger, now indifferent
- **Moët (basic)** — Same as Veuve
- **Pol Roger Cuvée Winston Churchill 2005** — Recent disappointment. "Didn't really think it was all that."
- **Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Rosé 2011** — "Nothing too special." Underwhelming given prestige cuvée status.
- **Telmont Réserve de la Terre** — Didn't like. Organic, low dosage, 54% Chard / 40% Meunier / 6% PN.

Note: Will still drink the above if served, but won't seek out. "It's ok!"

## Price Tiers & Occasions

| Occasion | Price Range | Typical Choice |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Gift (someone's house) | $40-50 | — |
| Home, just Melissa | $50-60 | Ruinart Rosé (half bottle) |
| Home, normal nice day | $100-150 | Ruinart Rosé, Savart Rosé (full bottle) |
| Hosting wine novices | $100-150 | Full bottle (same tier) |
| Hosting wine enthusiasts | $150-250+ | Tier up, possibly growers |
| Special occasion (birthday, milestone) | $250-350 | Bollinger GA Rosé, Grand Siècle, vintage Krug |
| Very rare splurge | $500+ | Clos d'Ambonnay-level bottles |

**Half bottle strategy:** Often buys half bottles for home consumption (just Carlos + Melissa). Allows opening nicer champagne without waste. "Lets us more easily open a Ruinart or something like that at home when it's just us two."

## Bucket List / Grails

Bottles Carlos wants to try before he dies:

1. **Salon** — 100% Chardonnay blanc de blancs. Curious even though expects Chardonnay-dominant style he likes less. "I assume it'll be similar to Clos du Mesnil. Just curious."
2. **Dom Pérignon P3** (Plénitude 3 — super-aged release). Note: Has had DP Rosé P2 1996.
3. **Very old Dom Pérignon P1** (vintage releases with age)
4. **Selosse Rosé**
5. **More vintage Krug**
6. **More Clos d'Ambonnay** — "Not die without having CdA a few more times"

## Sourcing & Storage

**Storage:** Limited. Wine fridge + cabinets. Not building a cellar. Buying to drink, not to age long-term.

**Where to buy:**
- **Millesime** (NYC)
- Caroline at **Curated Cellar** (friend who runs the business — source of education and high-end bottles)

**Sourcing challenges:**
- Savart Rosé: Hard to find
- Casa Valduga 130 Blanc de Noirs: Very hard to source (stretch goal: find a case)

---

## Context & Behavior

- **Food pairing:** Not a focus. Champagne is the main event. Drinks champagne without worrying about food pairing.
- **Grower champagnes:** Intentional pursuit. "Cool factor," especially for impressing knowledgeable friends at dinners.
- **Consumption volume:** "I think I've drank more champagne than I've disliked." Regular, high-volume consumer.
- **Taste evolution:** Clear progression from mass-market (Veuve, Moët) to prestige houses (Krug, Bollinger) to growers (Savart, Egly, Selosse).

## Notes for Eddie

- Carlos is **picky** about what he consumes. High standards, deliberate choices.
- **Deep focus** strategy: Champagne only. Building real expertise vs. spreading thin across wine regions.
- **Mentorship model:** Learning from Caroline (expert guide) + trial and error.
- **Occasion intelligence:** Knows when to tier up/down. Won't waste prestige bottles on people who won't appreciate them.
- **Half bottle hack:** Smart move for frequent consumption without waste.
- **Wedding champagne** as sourcing challenge: Emotional/sentimental value, not just taste.
